# RFM-model
This is used to store the RFM model case analyses I have done. 

RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a marketing technique used to segment and analyze customers based on their behavior. Here's what each component of RFM represents:

Recency (R): This measures how recently a customer has interacted with your business. It assigns a score based on the time elapsed since the customer's last interaction, such as a purchase or website visit. A lower score indicates a more recent interaction, which is often more valuable.

Frequency (F): Frequency assesses how often a customer engages with your business. It calculates the number of interactions over a specific period. Customers with a higher frequency score are more engaged and loyal.

Monetary Value (M): This component reflects the monetary value of a customer's transactions. It can be based on the total spending, average order value, or other financial metrics. Customers with a higher monetary value are often more valuable to your business.
